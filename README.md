Analysis in Python

In this analysis we use python to perform an analysis on some budget data and on election data. In the budget data we look to find the average change in the profit/losses column and we also aim to find the greatest increase/decrease in profits. In the election data we want to find the total number of votes for each candidate and the winner of the election.
